# Vertical-project

The above drv_thread_entry.c file is for V1504. As merge between multilift and V1504 is not done yet. So copy this file in the VerticalControl/src folder if you want to run V1504. There are quite a few difference apart from just power board logic.
Will sort this out after my holidays. Thanks
